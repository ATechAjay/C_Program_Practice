/*1. Local variable: Local variable defined within the body of the function
This variable only called locally in the body of the function.
like:
    int func(int t)
    {
        int a;
        -------
        -------
        -------
    }
Here a is a local variable.
2. Global variable: This variable defined outside the body of the
funcrtion are called global variable.
All functions in the program can be access and modify the global 
variable.
Global variable is automatically initialized to 0 at the time of
declaration.

NOTE:- Whenever there is conflict between local and global variable, then local variable 
gets higher precedence.
